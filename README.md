#Alfred - Facebook chat bot match maker

##A bot built using Botkit

Built using Node.js and the Botkit framework.

##The features

What makes Alfred great is its ability to match users based on their preferences and to give them the possibility to chat with persons with similar interests in life. Many functionalities could be added, such as more quizzes for better matching (we've implemented a simple quiz), cross-platform compatibility (the bot is currently working on Facebook Messenger), database integration (we currently use variables to store information), and a deeper NLP implementation for conversational features.

You are free to use Alfred for your projects!

##The technologies

We used the NPM modules Request to make requests to multiple APIs, Swearjar and Profanity Cleanser for moderate NLP, and Sybil for a preferences based matching process.
